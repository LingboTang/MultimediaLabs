I wrote this simple 3D viewer on windows 8 eclipse.

Therefore, if you want to play with my viewer. 

Simply use eclipse or just compile the file without using the command line.

My viewer will require you to input the Object file path.

Note that:
	
	1. The scroll bar on the top (north) is used to adjust the scale of the object

	2. The scroll bar on the right (east) is used to adjust the vertical position of the object.

	3. The scroll bar on the buttom (south) is used to adjust the horizontal position of the object.

If still have any problem, I can demo it on my own machine.

I added the load texture function and 3D function. But you'd best test the 3D function without rotating the object since somehow two different branchgroups are not sythesized.
And I don't have enough time to handle this problem.

Have fun with this!
